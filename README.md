# seqtools
Utilities for structured prediction of sequences, built on [pytorch-struct] and [mfst].

**NOTE:** This is an early-stage project under active development. As such, it
is subject to change without notice.

## Installation
Clone this repo and then install it with pip. Installation will go about 5 minutes without printing anything at some point, while it is installing `mfst`.
``` console
user@host:~$ pip install -e /PATH/TO/seqtools/
```

## Usage
See `tests` for usage examples (but there are none right now).
